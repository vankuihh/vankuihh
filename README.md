Yo I'm a newbie coder... tbh not really, just doing some more or less fun stuff that isn't beyond my capabilities which are totally low at the moment.
When I was young I was interested in coding and then for almost 6 years i did nothing in regard to it, so now I'm making a "comeback" - just writing some questionably useful programs with little to none programming skills.
If you would like to contribute i'd be extremely happy for anything that could help or inspire me... or my code.
I've always been kind of jack of all trades person, know a bit or more about everything and have skills and knowledge to do things.
Many hobbys, many interests, not working atm and planning to be a pilot in the future ;)))
Hopefully you'll find something useful here.
